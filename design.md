## 1 · Scope and layer

**Layer.** Below the contract (adapter), 1 kHz path. Knows the robot; rewritten per port.

**In scope.** Forward kinematics (observation side), numerical Jacobian and damped-least-squares
differential IK (action side), a Yoshikawa singularity monitor, an offline iterative pose solver,
and the three-site safety filter with intervention counting.

**Out of scope, on purpose.** Task→base rotation, integration into `q_send`, the admittance
reflex, the 1 kHz cyclic loop and its watchdog (all `kinova-wrapper` / `admittance-controller`).
Perception is out of scope for the whole portability argument: the socket is a fixed fixture and
lateral error is injected in software at reset.

**Convention.** Classical Denavit–Hartenberg, 8 frames (rows 0–7), radians throughout
`[MEASURED — convention confirmed by FK checks, §8.1]`. The public API takes and returns radians;
the deg↔rad seam is owned by the 1 kHz loop (D-25).

**Idea 5 goal, current wording.** One frozen force-conditioned policy performs a connector
insertion across kinematically different cobots driven through position/velocity interfaces.
Real validation on a Gen3 7-DOF; cross-body evidence primarily in MuJoCo, with a Gen3 6-DOF in
the lab as a stretch objective; zero target-robot data, zero gradient steps on the policy. The
claim is **architectural portability**, not hardware-agnosticism. Every target arm requires a
mounted, calibrated 6-axis wrist F/T sensor — a stated precondition, not an accessory.

  Dotted dependency: q_meas (OBS) is also the point at which J is evaluated (ACTION). It is the
  only quantity that crosses sides, and it crosses as an input, never as a policy observation.
```

`solveIK` is not on either path. It is an iterative *pose* solver for offline planning and
test fixtures; its error-proportional damping (`λ = 0.5·‖e‖ + 1e-4`) is meaningful only when
there is a pose error, so it must never be carried into the differential solve.

## 4 · Interfaces

Authoritative frames and units. A frame or unit error is the most expensive class of bug in
this project.

| Function | Side | Input | Output | Frame | Units |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `computeFK(q)` | OBS | `array<double,7>` | `Matrix4d` T | T in **base**, includes tool offset along the final frame's local z | rad → m |
| `getPosition(T)` / `getRotation(T)` | OBS | `Matrix4d` | `Vector3d` / `Matrix3d` | base | m / — |
| `computeJacobian(q)` | ACTION | `array<double,7>` | `Matrix<6,7>` | base | rows 0–2 m/rad; rows 3–5 dimensionless |

| `SafetyFilter::clipJoint(q̇, q_send)` | ACTION, Site 3 | `Matrix<7,1>` ×2 | `JointFilterResult` | joint space | rad/s; rad |

```cpp

    Eigen::Matrix<double,6,1> twist_achieved;  // J·qdot, BASE [m/s; rad/s]; differs from the
                                               // command by the damping residual
    double lambda_used;                        // NaN until a solve ran (mixed units, §5.3.3)
    double manipulability;                     // NaN by design (D-20) — never computed here
    bool   ok;                                 // false ⇒ qdot is zero; do not command
};
```

**Two unit boundaries the caller owns, both known bug sources:**

1. **Task → base.** The policy and the reflex work in the task frame (latched at CONTACT entry).
   `jointVelocityDLS` takes a base-frame twist. Apply a **rotation only**, never the 4×4
   homogeneous transform: a twist is a vector pair, not a point, and applying the translation
   leaks a phantom offset.
2. **rad/s → deg/s.** The loop integrates into `q_send`, which is in degrees (Kortex
   `feedback.actuators(i).position()` is degrees `[SPEC]`). Convert at the integration step:
   `q_send_deg += q̇_rad_s · (180/π) · dt`. Omitting it produces motion 57× too slow that looks
   exactly like a damping problem.

**Not this library's job — and where it lives**

| Excluded | Why | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Velocity clamping inside DLS | Would distort the twist direction and hide it from the one auditable safety layer | SafetyFilter Site 3 |
| Null-space projection | A secondary objective changes q̇ for reasons unrelated to the command and makes the λ sweep uninterpretable | Deferred, post-Phase-0 |
| Task→base rotation | Would give this library a dependency on task state | 1 kHz loop |
| Integration to position | `q_send` is the loop's integrator state; the library must be stateless w.r.t. the loop | 1 kHz loop |
| Joint-limit checking inside DLS | Same as clamping: one auditable layer | SafetyFilter Site 3 |

## 5 · Algorithms

Each subsection answers: inputs/outputs with frames and units; why this and not the obvious
alternative; how it fails; what number proves it and where that number was measured.

### 5.1 Forward kinematics

**In/out.** q [rad] → T ∈ SE(3), base frame, metres. Classical DH,
`T_i = Rot_z(θ)·Trans_z(d)·Trans_x(a)·Rot_x(α)`, row 0 is the fixed base frame, rows 1–7 carry
joint angles plus offsets, then a pure translation `tool_offset_z` along the final frame's local z.

| Frame | α | a | d [m] | θ offset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (base) | π | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | π/2 | 0 | −0.2848 | 0 |
| 2 | π/2 | 0 | −0.0118 | π |
| 3 | π/2 | 0 | −0.4208 | π |
| 4 | π/2 | 0 | −0.0128 | π |
| 5 | π/2 | 0 | −0.3143 | π |
| 6 | π/2 | 0 | 0 | π |
| 7 | π | 0 | −0.1674 | π |
| tool | — | — | +0.113 along local z | — |

Link lengths `[SPEC — Kinova Gen3 7-DOF kinematic parameters; Sahil to record the exact User
Guide table/figure reference]`. Convention `[MEASURED]`: classical DH reproduces flange
z = 1.1873 m at q = 0 and passes symmetry checks (§8.1). Tool offset `[MEASURED]` 0.113 m
flange-to-tip for the current test handle (D-14); a constructor parameter, not a literal.

**Why classical, not modified DH.** Empirical: the classical chain matched the Kortex-reported
pose in the earlier high-level phase and the modified chain did not `[MEASURED, D-series entry —
run not identified here; see design_decisions.md]`.

**Fails when** a joint angle is non-finite (propagates to every element of T — caught upstream
in `jointVelocityDLS`, not in `computeFK`), or when the DH table is transcribed in degrees.

**Number.** z = 1.1873 m at q = 0 `[COMPUTED]`. Hardware comparison pending; it will carry ~7 mm
by construction (Kortex configured 0.12 m vs measured 0.113 m).

### 5.2 Jacobian — numerical

**In/out.** q [rad] → J ∈ ℝ^{6×7}, base frame; rows 0–2 [m/rad], rows 3–5 dimensionless.
Forward finite difference, `eps = 1e-6` rad `[DESIGN]`: 8 DH-chain evaluations per call, linear
part `(p₁ − p₀)/eps`, angular part the vee of `R₁R₀ᵀ` divided by `2·eps`.

**Why numerical.** It is fast enough — the whole `jointVelocityDLS` call is 1.90 µs mean
`[MEASURED]` — and it cannot disagree with the FK it is derived from. An analytic Jacobian is the
fallback only if a timing problem appears; none has.

**Fails when** `eps` is too small (cancellation) or too large (truncation) — 1e-6 is a
conventional middle `[DESIGN, not swept]`; and when q is non-finite.

**Number.** Analytic `Jv` vs central finite difference agree to 1.4e-10 at a random non-singular
pose `[COMPUTED — independent Python reimplementation, Sep 2026; not yet reproduced from
`computeJacobian` in C++]`.

### 5.3 Damped least-squares differential IK

#### 5.3.1 The problem

**In/out.** twist v (base, [m/s; rad/s]) and measured q_meas [rad] → q̇ [rad/s] with
`J(q_meas)·q̇ ≈ v`. J is 6×7: six equations, seven unknowns — **underdetermined**. There is an
infinite family of exact solutions; the question is which one, not how to approximate an
unreachable one. The right object is the minimum-norm solution `q̇ = Jᵀ(JJᵀ)⁻¹v`. The
least-squares form `(JᵀJ)⁻¹Jᵀ` is for the overdetermined case and is wrong here — `JᵀJ` is 7×7
and singular by construction.

#### 5.3.2 Why damping, and the derived bound

Each singular direction of the pseudoinverse is scaled by `1/σ`; near a singularity `σ → 0` and
a small commanded twist demands unbounded joint velocity — on hardware, a violent uncommanded
motion. Damping replaces the gain:

```
1/σ  →  g(σ) = σ / (σ² + λ²)          q̇ = Jᵀ (J Jᵀ + λ² I₆)⁻¹ v
```

`g → 0` as `σ → 0`: the solve stops trying to move in directions the arm cannot move in.

**BOUND-1** `[DERIVED]`. `g'(σ) = (λ² − σ²)/(σ² + λ²)²` is zero at `σ = λ`, giving
`g_max = 1/(2λ)`. Hence for any commanded twist

```
‖q̇‖ ≤ ‖v‖ / (2λ)                                                (BOUND-1)
```

Exact and reproducible by hand. Attained only when the twist aligns with a singular direction
whose σ equals λ. This is the number that makes Site 3's clamp threshold defensible rather than
arbitrary. Tests: `AmplificationCeilingIsAttainedWhenSigmaEqualsLambda` (tight),
`NeverExceedsTheAmplificationCeiling` (upper bound over λ × σ grid),
`RespectsTheAmplificationCeilingAcrossConfigurations` (real Jacobians).

#### 5.3.3 Choosing λ — the tension, and the mixed-units defect

A single constant λ cannot satisfy both requirements at once `[DERIVED]`:

| λ | Near singularity | Normal operation |
|---|---|---|
| Large (0.29) | Tight bound, safe | Heavy loss: 49 % at σ = 0.297, 78 % at σ = 0.152 (§5.3.4) |
| Small (0.05) | BOUND-1 gives ‖q̇‖ ≤ 10·‖v‖ — too loose to rely on alone | Accurate tracking |

The literature answer is variable damping keyed to σ_min, which needs an SVD every cycle —
not measured, and a different, more expensive operation than the LDLᵀ solve.

**Decision `[DESIGN]`.** λ is held small and constant for tracking; the velocity bound is
enforced downstream at Site 3. **Provisional λ = 0.05** — a starting point, replaced by the λ
sweep (§7 item 7). λ is a per-call parameter, validated inside `solveDLS`
(`!(λ > 0) || !isfinite(λ)` rejects 0, negative, NaN, ±∞). λ must be strictly positive: at
λ = 0, `JJᵀ` may be exactly singular and the factorisation is no longer guaranteed.

**Mixed units — a real defect, not fixed in v1.** `λ²I₆` adds the same scalar to all six
diagonal entries of `JJᵀ`, but the blocks of `JJᵀ` carry units m²/rad², m/rad and 1. The
effective damping on translation and on rotation differs by roughly the square of a
characteristic length; a λ tuned for translation is not the λ for rotation. Recorded so it is
never mistaken for a tuning problem. *Proposal, not in locked scope, deferred to 6.5:*
pre-multiply twist and J by `W = diag(1/L,1/L,1/L,1,1,1)`, L a characteristic arm length
(order 0.5 m). It changes the meaning of λ; decide after the sweep, never during it.
Dimensional inhomogeneity of the Jacobian and the "characteristic length" remedy are known in
the literature `[UNVERIFIED — Sahil must check primary sources before citing]`.

#### 5.3.4 λ is robot-specific — measured spectrum and link-scale sensitivity

λ is a threshold on σ, and the σ spectrum depends on the arm's geometry. σ has no consistent
unit (m/rad for translation-dominated directions, dimensionless for rotation-dominated), so
neither does λ — the §5.3.3 defect in the form that matters for tuning.

**Spectrum at `kHomeRad`** (the `test_dls.cpp` fixture; tool offset 0.113 m; reach 0.716 m)
`[COMPUTED — independent Python reimplementation of the DH table, Sep 2026; cross-checked by FK
z = 1.1873 at q = 0 and Jv agreement 1.4e-10; NOT yet reproduced from `computeJacobian`]`.
"% linear" = ‖u_v‖², the translational share of that direction; "lost" = λ²/(σ²+λ²).

| σ | % linear | lost at λ = 0.05 | lost at λ = 0.29 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.893 | 16 | 0.1 % | 2.3 % |
| 1.798 | 19 | 0.1 % | 2.5 % |
| 1.175 | 1 | 0.2 % | 5.7 % |
| 0.297 | 99 | 2.8 % | 49 % |
| 0.180 | 84 | 7.1 % | 72 % |
| 0.152 | 80 | 9.7 % | 78 % |

Damping engages on translation, not rotation, at this pose. `kHomeRad` is not the worst pose
seen — σ ≈ 0.105 has been observed at an ordinary pose `[COMPUTED, pose not recorded — record
it before citing]`.

**Link-scale sensitivity** — same solver, same λ, same joint configuration; only the DH `d`
values and the tool offset scaled by k `[COMPUTED, same provenance]`:

| k (k = 1 is the Gen3) | reach [m] | σ_min | σ_min(k)/σ_min(1) | k | linear share | rot share | lost at λ = 0.05 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 0.716 | 0.1519 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 80.1 % | 19.9 % | 9.8 % |
| 0.5 | 0.358 | 0.0823 | 0.5418 | 0.5000 | 94.2 % | 5.8 % | 27.0 % |
| 0.1 | 0.072 | 0.0169 | 0.1113 | 0.1000 | 99.8 % | 0.2 % | 89.7 % |

1. σ_min shrinks with the arm but not proportionally: scaling scales `Jv` by k and leaves `Jω`
   alone. "σ scales with link length" is false as a flat statement.
2. The singular direction re-orients toward pure translation. No closed-form correction; the SVD
   must be recomputed, not rescaled.
3. A fixed λ becomes destructive on a smaller arm: 9.8 % loss on the Gen3 becomes 89.7 % at
   tenth scale, at the same, non-singular configuration.

λ lives in the adapter, below the contract. A per-robot λ does not weaken the
architectural-portability claim — it is exactly the kind of robot-specific quantity the
contract exists to keep below the boundary.

**Procedure for a new robot** `[DERIVED from BOUND-1]`:
1. Measure the spectrum over poses the arm will visit; record the smallest
   translation-dominated σ.
2. Upper bound from accuracy: for tolerable loss L, `λ ≤ σ·sqrt(L/(1−L))`. Gen3: σ = 0.152,
   L = 10 % → λ ≤ 0.0507 — reproduces the shipped 0.05.
3. Lower bound from the velocity cap, *only if damping is the sole limiter*:
   `λ ≥ ‖v‖_max / (2·q̇_cap)`. Gen3: 0.559/(2·2.094) = 0.133.
4. Verify by sweep on the new arm.

Steps 2 and 3 are incompatible on the Gen3 (0.05 < 0.133) — deliberately. λ = 0.05 permits
‖q̇‖ ≤ 5.59 rad/s against a 2.094 rad/s cap, which is why Site 3 fires in normal operation
(‖q̇‖ = 3.39 rad/s observed at mid-workspace poses `[COMPUTED — pose not recorded]`) rather than
acting as last resort. **λ buys accuracy; Site 3 enforces the cap.**

*Deferred alternative:* adaptive λ keyed to an online σ_min estimate `[UNVERIFIED literature —
Sahil must check before citing any author]`. Cost of a per-cycle σ_min estimate at 1 kHz is not
measured. Forcing trigger: before a second robot enters MuJoCo.

#### 5.3.5 Numerical method — LDLᵀ, no inverse

```
A = J Jᵀ + λ² I₆        6×6, symmetric, positive definite for λ > 0   (xᵀAx = ‖Jᵀx‖² + λ²‖x‖² > 0)
solve A y = v           LDLᵀ, y ∈ ℝ⁶
q̇ = Jᵀ y                7×6 · 6×1
```

**Why 6×6, not 7×7.** `Jᵀ(JJᵀ+λ²I₆)⁻¹ = (JᵀJ+λ²I₇)⁻¹Jᵀ` algebraically; the left form factorises
a 6×6, the right a 7×7. The 6×6 is cheaper and natural for the underdetermined case.

**Why LDLᵀ, not an explicit inverse or Cholesky.** No inverse is ever formed — `A.inverse()`
computes more than is needed and discards conditioning information. Plain Cholesky (LLT) is
also valid since A is SPD and marginally faster; LDLᵀ is chosen for backward stability, for
graceful degradation if A becomes near-semidefinite, and because the pivot diagonal is a free
conditioning indicator for later `[DESIGN]`. Fewer flops than forming the damped
pseudoinverse — order 3–4× `[UNVERIFIED — count it or measure it before citing a factor]`.

**Fails when** λ is not > 0 and finite (guarded), J or v non-finite (guarded — whether Eigen's
`info()` flags a NaN-filled matrix is `[UNVERIFIED]`, hence explicit `allFinite()` on both ends),
LDLᵀ reports failure, or the solution y is non-finite. All four ⇒ `ok = false`, `qdot` zero.

**Number.** 1.90 µs mean, 3.04 µs p99.9 for the full `jointVelocityDLS` call `[MEASURED]` §8.2.
Fixed-size `Matrix<double,6,6>`, stack-allocated, `noalias()`; no heap on the path
`[INFERRED from the tight p99.9-vs-mean gap]`.

### 5.4 Manipulability monitor

`w = sqrt(det(JJᵀ))` (Yoshikawa), one 6×6 determinant, floored at 0 before the sqrt (rounding
can make the computed det a tiny negative near singularity). Returns **NaN** when J is
non-finite — "could not compute" — never 0.0, which is a real value meaning "exactly singular".
`DlsResult::manipulability` stays NaN by design (D-20): the loop calls `manipulability(J)` and
decides. Carries the §5.3.3 mixed-units wart; one small σ can be masked by large others.
Choice of the production metric is deferred to 6.5 on measured timing (§9).

### 5.5 Offline pose solver — `solveIK`

DLS iteration with error-proportional damping `λ = 0.5·‖e‖ + 1e-4`, orientation error by vee of
`R_target·R_currentᵀ`, plus a null-space joint-centring term `α·(I − J⁺J)·z₀`, α = 0.5.
Dynamic-size Eigen, explicit inverse, `std::cerr` on non-convergence — acceptable **only**
because it never runs on the 1 kHz path. `max_iterations ≤ 0` returns failure with −1.0 error
norms ("did not run"). Round-trip smoke: 100 random configurations, expect ≥ 90 to close within
1 mm `[COMPUTED, test_fk.cpp; count not recorded here]`.

### 5.6 Safety filter — three sites

                                              position refusal, directional (inward passes)
```

Why three sites and not one: force exists only before the reflex consumes it; the Cartesian twist
only after the reflex supplies vz; joint rates only after DLS. Why uniform scaling: per-joint
clipping changes the joint-space direction, hence the Cartesian direction the DLS just solved
for. Why vz is excluded: two limiters in series on the force-controlled axis make neither one
analysable. Decision D-07: engineered clipping with logged interventions; a formal barrier
certificate is future work — a swap behind the same interface, not a retrain.

## 6 · Failure modes

| Mode | Where detected | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `q_meas` contains NaN/inf (dropped or partial BaseCyclic frame) | per-joint `isfinite` in `jointVelocityDLS` | `ok = false`, `qdot` zero, before it reaches the DH chain |
| `twist` or `J` non-finite | `allFinite()` in `solveDLS` | `ok = false`, `qdot` zero |
| λ ≤ 0, NaN, ±∞ (config typo) | guard in `solveDLS` | `ok = false`, `qdot` zero |
| LDLᵀ reports failure | Eigen `info() != Success` | `ok = false`, `qdot` zero |
| Solution y non-finite | `y.allFinite()` | `ok = false`, `qdot` zero |
| Near-singular configuration | `manipulability(J)` by the caller | **Not a failure.** Damping bounds it (BOUND-1); `ok` stays true; Site 3 caps; the caller decides |
| q outside joint limits | not checked in the IK | Site 3 position refusal, single-step lookahead |
| Non-finite input at any filter site | `isfinite` / `allFinite()` at each site | zero output, `NON_FINITE_REJECTED`, counted once per site; `pos_refused_mask = 0` |
| inf in a filter input | same guard | Caught explicitly — `inf > bound` is *true*, so an unguarded site would log a phantom intervention into the O3 count |

**`ok == false` means hold, not skip.** The loop's correct response is to keep `q_send` at its
previous value and still call `Refresh()` — skipping the call trips the firmware watchdog.

## 7 · Testing

All tests run off-robot; no mock is needed because there is no vendor dependency. `solveDLS`
being public (D-26) is what makes the linear algebra testable against an injected J.

**`test_dls.cpp` — 17 cases.** Fixtures are `[diag(s₀..s₅) | 0]` Jacobians, so singular values
are known exactly and one can be placed at σ = λ; a **duplicate-column** variant gives a
non-trivial null space so the minimum-norm claim is falsifiable rather than tautological.

1. Fixture self-check. 2. Pseudoinverse limit as λ → 0. 3. Minimum norm (even split across
duplicated joints). 4. Zero twist ⇒ exactly zero. 5. Linearity. 6. BOUND-1 attained at σ = λ.
7. BOUND-1 never exceeded over a λ × σ grid. 8. λ monotonicity (slower, larger residual).
9. Diagnostics describe the solve that ran. 10–12. Guards: λ (0, negative, NaN, **inf** — inf
passes `λ > 0` and is caught only by `isfinite`), non-finite J, non-finite twist.
13. Non-finite q at every joint. 14. BOUND-1 on real Jacobians at four configurations, σ_min
printed from a test-only SVD. 15–17. `manipulability`: known value 720, rank-deficient ⇒ 0.0,
non-finite ⇒ NaN.

**`test_safety_filter.cpp` — 28 cases.** Each bound in isolation; sign preservation at Site 1;
vz exclusion from both Site 2 norms; α/β independence; inward motion allowed at the workspace
faces and past joint limits (recovery); uniform-scaling ratio preservation; continuous-joint
sentinels never refuse; zero-input paths (HOLD runs them 1000×/s); non-finite rejection at all
three sites with telemetry pinned (no phantom bound counts); counter accumulation, `total()`,
`reset()`, and 1000 nominal cycles with zero interventions. Tolerance `kTol = 1e-9` — seven
orders above double round-off on O(1) SI quantities, eight below the smallest meaningful bound
difference `[DERIVED]`.

**Benchmarks** (`benchmark_dls.cpp`, `benchmark_safety_filter.cpp`) are not tests; the filter
benchmark asserts its counter invariants and exits 1 on disagreement.

**Fixture warning — q = 0 is a singularity** `[COMPUTED]`: rank 3, three singular values exactly
zero from this DH table. Valid as an FK fixture (z = 1.1873 m validates the table), invalid for
anything conditioning-related and invalid as the loop's initialisation pose.

**Pending:** 7. λ sweep — λ vs residual (nominal pose) and peak ‖q̇‖ (near-singular pose);
selects production λ. Hardware FK-vs-Kortex (Step 3).

**Determinism.** No randomness in gtest cases; `test_fk.cpp` uses a fixed seed (42).

## 8 · Measured results

### 8.1 FK checks `[COMPUTED]`

Flange z = 1.1873 m at q = 0 (before tool offset); ±0.3 rad on joint 1 gives equal z and
mirrored x. Validates the DH table, not the Jacobian (q = 0 is singular).

### 8.2 Differential IK latency `[MEASURED]`

`benchmark_dls`, 4 Sep 2026, N = 10⁶, RelWithDebInfo (`-O2 -g -DNDEBUG -std=gnu++17`, verified
in `compile_commands.json` 4 Sep 2026), SCHED_FIFO `chrt -f 80`, `taskset -c 2` (P-core).

| mean | p50 | p99 | p99.9 | max (1 in 10⁶) | budget |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.90 µs | 1.86 µs | 2.35 µs | **3.04 µs** | 94.4 µs | 1000 µs |

0.2 % of the cycle typically, 0.3 % at the 1-in-1000 tail. Jacobian/solve split **not measured**
— the expectation that the numerical Jacobian dominates is `[UNVERIFIED]`; split at 6.5 only if
a budget problem appears.

### 8.3 Safety filter latency `[MEASURED]`

`benchmark_safety_filter`, 4 Sep 2026, N = 10⁶ per scenario, same protocol as §8.2 (which is
what makes the two numbers comparable). Two runs of identical code, `run1 / run2` where they
differ, all ns:

| Scenario | mean | batched | p50 | p99 | p99.9 | max |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| NOMINAL | 21.0 / 20.7 | 10.0 / 10.1 | 21 | 27 / 26 | 35 / 33 | 5391 / 1623 |
| ALL_TRIP | 30.2 / 30.5 | 15.0 / 15.2 | 30 | 36 / 35 | 39 / 38 | 1311 / 964 |
| ALTERNATING | 25.6 | 12.6 / 12.5 | 28 / 27 | 35 / 34 | 40 / 36 | 1142 / 6851 |
| NON_FINITE | 12.6 | 5.1 / 5.0 | 13 | 14 | 21 / 26 | 785 / 7338 |

**Reportable:** worst p99.9 across scenarios and runs **≤ 40 ns** = 0.004 % of the cycle.
**True single-cycle cost is bracketed 5–30 ns**: `batched` (64 cycles per clock-read pair)
excludes clock overhead but runs back to back as the real loop never does — lower bound;
`mean` (per-iteration) pays one clock read the real loop never pays — upper bound. Report the
bracket, never either column alone.

**No worst-case scenario is named.** The label moved between the runs (ALTERNATING 40 ns, then
ALL_TRIP 38 ns) on identical code; the scenarios are 1–5 ns apart at single-digit-ns clock
resolution. The branch-predictor hypothesis behind ALTERNATING is neither supported nor refuted.
The `max` column is OS events, not filter work: the outlier landed on NOMINAL in one run and
NON_FINITE in the other.

**Counter invariants, same runs:** NOMINAL all counters 0; ALL_TRIP 1,000,000 on every bound,
mask 42; ALTERNATING 500,000 on every bound (confirms the table cycles), mask 42; NON_FINITE
`non_finite_rejected` = 3,000,000 = 3 × N.

### 8.4 Composed cost — estimate, not a result

Mean-sum 1.90 µs + ~0.02 µs ≈ 1.9 µs; tail-sum 3.04 µs + 0.04 µs ≈ 3.1 µs. The p99.9 of a sum
is not the sum of the p99.9s (that assumes perfectly correlated tails — conservative, not
measured). The reportable composed number comes from instrumenting the assembled loop end to
end (Step 8). Against the ~650 µs left after the ~350 µs mean `Refresh()` round-trip
`[MEASURED on hardware, Step 3, kinova-wrapper]`, both estimates are go.

### 8.5 Clock floor — conflicted, not cited

Readings of 9 ns and 13 ns exist across sources for the same measurement. Resolve before
publishing any timing number (Step 9). No figure in this document depends on it except the
5–30 ns bracket's interpretation, which holds under either value.

### 8.6 Verification ledger

## 9 · Open decisions

| ID / item | Gates | What settles it |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 obs width 38 vs 39 | MuJoCo environment build | Decision with Prof. Ahmadi on the recovery phase |
| D-04 manifest mechanism | Sourcing `SafetyBounds` and joint limits from one place | Block A Step 6 |
| D-07 CBF vs engineered clipping | Decided: clipping. Barrier certificate is future work | Prof. Ahmadi, only if reopened |
| D-09 final bound values | O3 being meaningful | Trained action distribution |
| D-14 tool offset | Hardware FK check | Step 3 records FK-vs-Kortex with the 7 mm accounted for |
| D-20 manipulability metric | Singularity monitor in the loop | Wall-clock cost of each candidate against the remaining budget (§5.4) — measure before choosing |
| D-27 joint-limit duplication and sentinel mismatch | Manifest schema; `pos_refused_mask` invariant | Single source of truth. ±2π (kinematics) vs ±1e9 (filter) are **not equivalent**: 2π refuses at 6.28 rad, 1e9 never refuses; a manifest adopting ±2π silently changes the mask from 42 to 127 |
| Production λ | Hardware integration | λ sweep (§7 item 7) |
| Adaptive λ | Second robot in MuJoCo | Measure a per-cycle σ_min estimate's cost first |
| Position refusal: is bounding `q_send` enough? | Whether Site 3 needs a margin | Step 3 overshoot measurement on joints 2/4/6: peak `q_meas − q_send` after a step, several speeds. If zero, `v·dt` on `q_send` is correct and the `stop_horizon_s` rename is dropped; otherwise add margin ε to `SafetyBounds` (with D-04). τ = 15.7 ms is the lag, not the fix — a τ horizon applies only to a check made against `q_meas` |
| `IKResult::joint_states` fill on failure (NaN vs zero) | Step 1 loop bring-up | Sahil decides |
| Clock-floor conflict | Any published timing number | Re-measure under one protocol (Step 9) |
| Firmware position-limit enforcement in low-level servoing | Whether Site 3 is the sole guard | SDK header grep, Kinova support, or an empirical test on joint 4 |
| Sustained-intervention flag | Reflex integrator divergence under sustained scaling | Undecided whether the filter raises a flag or only counts |

## 10 · Limitations

- Everything has run off-robot only. Hardware FK, τ on the limited joints, and firmware limit
  behaviour are pending.
- The Jacobian is numerical; `eps` is unswept.
- One scalar λ across mixed-unit rows; λ is per-robot and must be re-tuned on every port.
- The composed loop cost is an estimate; the clock floor is conflicted.
- Site 2 mixes a task-frame twist with a base-frame position; valid only near axis alignment.
- Site 3 bounds the commanded setpoint, not the measured joint. Lag alone cannot cause a
  violation; servo overshoot could, and is not measured (Step 3).
- `SafetyBounds` defaults are header literals awaiting D-04/D-09; joint limits are duplicated
  and drifted (D-27).
- The σ-spectrum and link-scale tables come from a Python reimplementation, not from this C++.
- No literature is cited with authors here because none has been read in primary form.
- Precondition inherited from the stack: an external, calibrated 6-axis wrist F/T sensor.
